         <li>⚪ I worked for a month selling movie tickets.<br>
             ⚪ I decided to do it to take advantage of my vacations at that time.<br>
             ⚪ I had a high return, I sold much more than other colleagues who already had more time than me.</li>

         <li>The only project I've ever worked on was one last semester.</li>
         <br>
         <li>⚫ The project consisted of creating a web page linked to a database, and that would have some real utility.</li>
         <li>⚫ We had 2 months to do it and I worked together with 2 classmates.</li>
         <li>⚫ Unfortunately we could not polish the program, we had many errors when linking the database with the page but the page was well distributed and made.</li>
